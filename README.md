# OpenStackAndroidApp

This is an Android app for viewing instances on OpenStack. The app was made as a university project. 

The application uses the Identity API to sign in a user and select a project. It will then use the Compute API to list instances and allow a few simple actions such as pausing, stopping or rebooting an instance.
